<p>UTC is the worst; and it’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Coordinated_Universal_Time&amp;oldid=853902464#Future">going to get way worse</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some time in the 22nd century, two leap seconds will be required every year.
The current use of only the leap second opportunities in June and December
will be insufficient, and the March and September options will have to be
used. In the 25th century, four leap seconds will be required every year, so
the current quarterly options will be insufficient. Thereafter there will need
to be the possibility of leap seconds at the end of any month. In about two
thousand years, even that will be insufficient, and there will have to be leap
seconds that are not at the end of a month. <strong>In a few tens of thousands of
years (the timing is uncertain), LOD will exceed 86,401 s, causing UTC to
require more than one leap second per day.</strong></p>

<p>In 40.000 years People will hate us for three things: Global warming, Nuclear
waste, and UTC LEAP SECONDS!</p>
