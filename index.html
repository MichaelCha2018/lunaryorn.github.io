<p>So far I never really cared for the difference between X11 and wayland, but I recently realized that wayland supports semi HiDPI setups whereas X11 doesn’t.
And it also adds kinetic scrolling with touchpads.</p>

<p>That’s nice!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some time in the 22nd century, two leap seconds will be required every year.
The current use of only the leap second opportunities in June and December
will be insufficient, and the March and September options will have to be
used. In the 25th century, four leap seconds will be required every year, so
the current quarterly options will be insufficient. Thereafter there will need
to be the possibility of leap seconds at the end of any month. In about two
thousand years, even that will be insufficient, and there will have to be leap
seconds that are not at the end of a month. <strong>In a few tens of thousands of
years (the timing is uncertain), LOD will exceed 86,401 s, causing UTC to
require more than one leap second per day.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In 40.000 years People will hate us for three things: Global warming, Nuclear
waste, and UTC LEAP SECONDS!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Object-Oriented Meets Functional<br>
— <cite>Scala’s punchline, <a href="https://scala-lang.org">https://scala-lang.org</a></cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Scala claims to unite object-oriented and functional programming, and offers a rich set features from both worlds.
Developers coming from object-oriented languages—Java in particular—quickly adopt the object-oriented features of Scala but often struggle to find their way around functional programming.
Some aspects of functional programming found their way into object-oriented languages:  Higher order functions or combinators like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">map</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">filter</code> appear in today’s C# or Java code, and even a preference for immutable data structures spreads out into conventional object-oriented languages.</p>

<p>But algebraic data types (ADTs) still do not appear in object-oriented programming although these enable the true power of functional programming:  Types well-founded on theory let us model the problem domain in types and thus help us write correct-by-construction code which provides a higher level of compile-time confidence than possible with the type systems of most object-oriented languages.
This article aims to help developers from object-oriented languages understand what it means, and become familiar with the basic set of algebraic data types commonly used in functional programming and its appearance in Scala.</p>

<p>Last week I got a big PDF with documentation about the
almost-but-not-quite-entirely-unlike-REST HTTP API of an external partner. In
the section about restrictions of their HTTP API:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For this functionality we recommend to use the SOAP API.
This <em>convenient</em> interface offers almost <em>unlimited</em> possibilities to integrate Foo.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Emphasis mine.  I have <a href="http://harmful.cat-v.org/software/xml/soap/simple">different memories</a> of SOAP.</p>

<p>The popular CI server <a href="https://jenkins-ci.org">Jenkins</a> has a JSON API to access
builds, but its JSON has a rather strange shape:  Relevant information sits in a
generic <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">actions</code> array containing objects of various different shapes (even
empty objects for whatever reason):</p>

<h1 id="emacs-script-pitfalls">Emacs script pitfalls</h1>

<p>Emacs isn’t just an editor, it’s an entire Emacs Lisp interpreter and
environment.  We can use Emacs Lisp not only to extend and customize our beloved
editor, but also to write entire programs and applications.  Nic Ferrier’s
<a href="https://github.com/nicferrier/elnode">elnode</a> server is the most ambitious Emacs Lisp application of this sort, but
we can start at a smaller scale and try to write our shell scripts and tools
with Emacs Lisp.</p>

<p>However, it turns out that writing programs in Emacs Lisp is more intricate than
it looks at a first glance.  Emacs decades-long history as interactive
application have left deep marks in Emacs and Emacs Lisp, which make independent
noninteractive scripts difficult.</p>
